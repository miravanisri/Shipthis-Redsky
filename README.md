# 🚀 Shipthis-Redsky

## 🧩 Project Summary
This project is a modern **React-based web application** built using **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**.  
The goal was to design a clean, responsive, and modular UI with reusable components and smooth animations.  

### ⚙️ Key Decisions
- **Tooling:**
  - Used **Vite** for fast development and optimized build times.  
  - Adopted **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first and responsive styling.  
  - Implemented **Framer Motion** for first-time page load animations and smooth UI transitions.  
  - Followed a modular folder structure for scalability and maintainability.  

- **Libraries Used:**
  - `react` – Component-based frontend framework  
  - `framer-motion` – For animations and transitions  
  - `tailwindcss` – For modern, responsive styling  
  - `vite` – For fast builds and development server  

- **Project Structure:**
```src/
├── assets/ # Images and icons
├── components/ # Reusable UI components
├── pages/ # Page-level components (e.g., Home)
├── App.jsx # Root component
├── App.css # Global styles
└── main.jsx # Entry point
```
